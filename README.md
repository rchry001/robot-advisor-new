# robot-advisor-new


# For this situation script follow these steps:

# 1. Clone the repo to your Github desktop and set up the virtual environment

# 2.  Always make sure you are in the right directory

# 3. Create a requirements.txt file

# 4. Install Pip install packages using the command line



### Use the GitHub.com online interface to create a new remote project repository called something like "robo-advisor". When prompted by the GitHub.com online interface, let's get in the habit of adding a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file (and also optionally a "LICENSE") during the repo creation process. After this process is complete, you should be able to view the repo on GitHub.com at an address like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/robo-advisor.

# After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

# Use your text editor or the command-line to create a new file called "requirements.txt" in the root directory of your repository, and then place inside the following contents:

# this is the "requirements.txt" file
# it might be helpful to use pandas. if you do, uncomment the last line below ...

# requests
# python-dotenv
# pandas 

# Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment:

# conda create -n stocks-env python=3.8 # (first time only)
# conda activate stocks-env
# From within the virtual environment, install the required packages specified in the "requirements.txt" file you created:

# pip install -r requirements.txt
# From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python # script from the command-line:

# this is the command to run script - python app/robo_advisor.py
